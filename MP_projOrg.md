4) Run script with two arguments

```bash
python .\projOrg.py def "d:\Motion Pro\Lesson_Materials\LS02-2\"
```

* def – First required argument. Folder structure type. In our script already added three structures: “def”, “classic” and “advanced”. Use the "def" type for our lessons.
* ‘’path” - Second required argument. The absolute path to the folder where you want to create the folder structure.

Notes:

- Observe the order of the arguments. First the structure type, then the folder path
- Put the folder path in quotation to avoid errors
